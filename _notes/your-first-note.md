## Regulatory Developments

- As of the start of 2023, EHRs are required by the Cures Act Final to implement new capabilities:
  - public FHIR APIs to promote standardized data exchange
  - SMART–on–FHIR to standardize authorization and authentication for third-party apps to connect to APIs
- Many EHR vendors, including Epic, Allscripts, Athena, have supported and publicly documented these capabilities for some time
- Importantly, for the 2023 reporting year, hospitals must use EHRs that have been updated with these capabilities to receive full incentive payments from the CMS Promoting Interoperability program

- Additionally, the 2023 CMS Interoperability rule mandates that payers must implement Patient Access APIs, with encourage to implement CMS’ Blue Button guide, which requires SMART flow
